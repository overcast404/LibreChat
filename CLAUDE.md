# Echo UI (LibreChat Fork)

## Project Overview

Echo UI is an Echo CoPaw–integrated fork of LibreChat. It adds a custom **Echo CoPaw** agent that renders structured process records (reasoning → tool calls → narrative → answer) within chat messages.

The monorepo has the following key workspaces:

| Workspace | Language | Side | Dependency | Purpose |
|---|---|---|---|---|
| `/api` | JS (legacy) | Backend | `packages/api`, `packages/data-schemas`, `packages/data-provider`, `@librechat/agents` | Express server — minimize changes here |
| `/packages/api` | **TypeScript** | Backend | `packages/data-schemas`, `packages/data-provider` | New backend code lives here (TS only, consumed by `/api`) |
| `/packages/data-schemas` | TypeScript | Backend | `packages/data-provider` | Database models/schemas, shareable across backend projects |
| `/packages/data-provider` | TypeScript | Shared | — | Shared API types, endpoints, data-service — used by both frontend and backend |
| `/client` | TypeScript/React | Frontend | `packages/data-provider`, `packages/client` | Frontend SPA |
| `/packages/client` | TypeScript | Frontend | `packages/data-provider` | Shared frontend utilities |

### Echo CoPaw Architecture

Echo CoPaw communicates with an adapter at `192.168.31.49:39088` (configured as the `QwenPaw` custom endpoint in `librechat.yaml`).

| Layer | Path | Purpose |
|---|---|---|
| Controller | `api/server/controllers/agents/echoCoPaw.js` | HTTP route handler for Echo CoPaw requests |
| Service | `api/server/services/EchoCoPaw/` | Business logic: streaming, files, content parts |
| Frontend | `client/src/components/Chat/Messages/Content/EchoThoughtBlock.tsx` | Structured process-record rendering |
| Frontend | `client/src/hooks/SSE/useStepHandler.ts` | SSE delta merging with Echo metadata preservation |

#### Echo CoPaw Frontend Details

- **Content phases**: Echo CoPaw messages carry `echo_copaw` metadata with phases `process`, `narrative`, `answer`. Each content part is annotated with `kind` (`message`, `reasoning`, `tool_call`) and `sourceId`.
- **EchoThoughtBlock**: Renders process-phase parts as an expandable step list. Tool calls show input/output when expanded; reasoning/message parts show their text content. A shimmer effect indicates the currently running step during submission.
- **Metadata preservation**: `useStepHandler.ts` uses `preserveEchoCoPawMetadata()` to ensure `echo_copaw` metadata survives SSE delta merges (text streaming, tool call updates). The metadata is propagated across `TEXT`, `THINK`, and `TOOL_CALL` content types.
- **File upload**: Echo CoPaw–specific file logic lives in `api/server/services/EchoCoPaw/files.js`, wired through custom routes in `api/server/routes/files/files.js`. File schema additions are in `packages/data-schemas/src/schema/file.ts` and `packages/data-schemas/src/types/file.ts`.

---

## Workspace Boundaries

- **All new backend code must be TypeScript** in `/packages/api`.
- Keep `/api` changes to the absolute minimum (thin JS wrappers calling into `/packages/api`).
- Database-specific shared logic goes in `/packages/data-schemas`.
- Frontend/backend shared API logic (endpoints, types, data-service) goes in `/packages/data-provider`.
- Build data-provider from project root: `npm run build:data-provider`.

---

## Code Style

### Naming and File Organization

- **Single-word file names** whenever possible (e.g., `permissions.ts`, `capabilities.ts`, `service.ts`).
- When multiple words are needed, prefer grouping related modules under a **single-word directory** rather than using multi-word file names (e.g., `admin/capabilities.ts` not `adminCapabilities.ts`).
- The directory already provides context — `app/service.ts` not `app/appConfigService.ts`.

### Structure and Clarity

- **Never-nesting**: early returns, flat code, minimal indentation. Break complex operations into well-named helpers.
- **Functional first**: pure functions, immutable data, `map`/`filter`/`reduce` over imperative loops. Only reach for OOP when it clearly improves domain modeling or state encapsulation.
- **No dynamic imports** unless absolutely necessary.

### DRY

- Extract repeated logic into utility functions.
- Reusable hooks / higher-order components for UI patterns.
- Parameterized helpers instead of near-duplicate functions.
- Constants for repeated values; configuration objects over duplicated init code.
- Shared validators, centralized error handling, single source of truth for business rules.
- Shared typing system with interfaces/types extending common base definitions.
- Abstraction layers for external API interactions.

### Iteration and Performance

- **Minimize looping** — especially over shared data structures like message arrays, which are iterated frequently throughout the codebase. Every additional pass adds up at scale.
- Consolidate sequential O(n) operations into a single pass whenever possible; never loop over the same collection twice if the work can be combined.
- Choose data structures that reduce the need to iterate (e.g., `Map`/`Set` for lookups instead of `Array.find`/`Array.includes`).
- Avoid unnecessary object creation; consider space-time tradeoffs.
- Prevent memory leaks: careful with closures, dispose resources/event listeners, no circular references.

### Type Safety

- **Never use `any`**. Explicit types for all parameters, return values, and variables.
- **Limit `unknown`** — avoid `unknown`, `Record<string, unknown>`, and `as unknown as T` assertions. A `Record<string, unknown>` almost always signals a missing explicit type definition.
- **Don't duplicate types** — before defining a new type, check whether it already exists in the project (especially `packages/data-provider`). Reuse and extend existing types rather than creating redundant definitions.
- Use union types, generics, and interfaces appropriately.
- All TypeScript and ESLint warnings/errors must be addressed — do not leave unresolved diagnostics.

### Comments and Documentation

- Write self-documenting code; no inline comments narrating what code does.
- JSDoc only for complex/non-obvious logic or intellisense on public APIs.
- Single-line JSDoc for brief docs, multi-line for complex cases.
- Avoid standalone `//` comments unless absolutely necessary.

### Import Order

Imports are organized into three sections:

1. **Package imports** — sorted shortest to longest line length (`react` always first).
2. **`import type` imports** — sorted longest to shortest (package types first, then local types; length resets between sub-groups).
3. **Local/project imports** — sorted longest to shortest.

Multi-line imports count total character length across all lines. Consolidate value imports from the same module. Always use standalone `import type { ... }` — never inline `type` inside value imports.

### JS/TS Loop Preferences

- **Limit looping as much as possible.** Prefer single-pass transformations and avoid re-iterating the same data.
- `for (let i = 0; ...)` for performance-critical or index-dependent operations.
- `for...of` for simple array iteration.
- `for...in` only for object property enumeration.

## Frontend Rules (`client/src/**/*`)

### Localization

- All user-facing text must use `useLocalize()`.
- Only update English keys in `client/src/locales/en/translation.json` (other languages are automated externally).
- Semantic key prefixes: `com_ui_`, `com_assistants_`, etc.

### Components

- TypeScript for all React components with proper type imports.
- Semantic HTML with ARIA labels (`role`, `aria-label`) for accessibility.
- Group related components in feature directories (e.g., `SidePanel/Memories/`).
- Use index files for clean exports.

### Data Management

- Feature hooks: `client/src/data-provider/[Feature]/queries.ts` → `[Feature]/index.ts` → `client/src/data-provider/index.ts`.
- React Query (`@tanstack/react-query`) for all API interactions; proper query invalidation on mutations.
- QueryKeys and MutationKeys in `packages/data-provider/src/keys.ts`.

### Data-Provider Integration

- Endpoints: `packages/data-provider/src/api-endpoints.ts`
- Data service: `packages/data-provider/src/data-service.ts`
- Types: `packages/data-provider/src/types/queries.ts`
- Use `encodeURIComponent` for dynamic URL parameters.

### Performance

- Prioritize memory and speed efficiency at scale.
- Cursor pagination for large datasets.
- Proper dependency arrays to avoid unnecessary re-renders.
- Leverage React Query caching and background refetching.

## Testing

- Framework: **Jest**, run per-workspace.
- Run tests from their workspace directory: `cd api && npx jest <pattern>`, `cd packages/api && npx jest <pattern>`, etc.
- Frontend tests: `__tests__` directories alongside components; use `test/layout-test-utils` for rendering.
- Cover loading, success, and error states for UI/data flows.

### Philosophy

- **Real logic over mocks.** Exercise actual code paths with real dependencies. Mocking is a last resort.
- **Spies over mocks.** Assert that real functions are called with expected arguments and frequency without replacing underlying logic.
- **MongoDB**: use `mongodb-memory-server` for a real in-memory MongoDB instance. Test actual queries and schema validation, not mocked DB calls.
- **MCP**: use real `@modelcontextprotocol/sdk` exports for servers, transports, and tool definitions. Mirror real scenarios, don't stub SDK internals.
- Only mock what you cannot control: external HTTP APIs, rate-limited services, non-deterministic system calls.
- Heavy mocking is a code smell, not a testing strategy.

## Formatting

Fix all formatting lint errors (trailing spaces, tabs, newlines, indentation) using auto-fix when available. All TypeScript/ESLint warnings and errors **must** be resolved.
